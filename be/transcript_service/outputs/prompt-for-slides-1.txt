I have an index.html file that appropriately includes reveal.js with the RevealMarkdown plugin. The file includes the following HTML snippet:
```
                <section data-markdown="CURRICULUM.md"></section>
```

Please provide the content for CURRICULUM.md that will allow me to render a slideshow.

The first slide should be a title slide. The second slide should have a table of contents.

Include at least one relevant hyperlink on each slide the directs the viewer to a valuable external resource or a citation for a statement on the slide. Hyperlinks should always open in a new tab.

With reveal.js, we can write a Markdown link that opens in a new tab using a special comment syntax like this: `<!-- .element: target="_blank" -->`. For example, consider the following slide Markdown snippet that makes use of this syntax:
```
### Interview Prep Stack

1. The Ladderly Curriculum. In Particular:
    - <a href="#job-search">The Job Search Section</a><!-- .element: target="_blank" -->
    - <a href="#external-resources">The External Resources Section</a><!-- .element: target="_blank" -->
