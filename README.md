## background ✨

This application is an entry into the 2023 Supabase Hackathon on the theme of AI.

This solves a meaningful problem for open source educational development at [Ladderly](https://ladderly.io/).

Specifically, open source educational content in the ladderly-slides repository is sourced mainly from social media messages from John Vandivier, a TikTok Tech influencer and educator. This project automates the laborious work of transforming TikTok videos into four always-synchronized educational outputs:

1. Slides for Ladderly-Slides
2. Flash Cards
3. Quizzes
4. A Conversational AI Agent

The term `rect` comes from the fact that this application has four main points, or purposes, which are those four items named above.
